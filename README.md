# Ending word

I know this is not the 'cleanest' solution You will see, but what I wanted to highlight, is simply, that i can do these features. For example, I wouldn't color-code the `<li>` components depending on their regions, but I did 
it just to show You that I can.
All in all, it works, the server was acting up the day I was completing this assignment, so i added some cheeky solutions to that. Thank You for the opportunity to complete it, and I hope to hear from You soon.
